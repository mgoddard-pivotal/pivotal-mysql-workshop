# Workshop to explore various topics related to running the Pivotal MySQL database as a service

## Part 2

### Setup – HA cluster (Galera)
* Create an instance of an HA MySQL DB
  We can get this done using the Apps Manager GUI, or we can use the command line, as shown here:
  ```
  $ cf create-service p.mysql db-ha-galera ha-mysql
  Creating service instance ha-mysql in org pde / space dev as mgoddard...
  OK

  Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service ha-mysql' to check operation status.

  $ cf services
  Getting services in org pde / space dev as mgoddard...

  name           service   plan           bound apps     last operation       broker                   upgrade available
  db-small-dev   p.mysql   single-node    spring-music   create succeeded     dedicated-mysql-broker
  ha-mysql       p.mysql   db-ha-galera                  create in progress   dedicated-mysql-broker

  $ cf services
  Getting services in org pde / space dev as mgoddard...

  name           service   plan           bound apps     last operation     broker                   upgrade available
  db-small-dev   p.mysql   single-node    spring-music   create succeeded   dedicated-mysql-broker
  ha-mysql       p.mysql   db-ha-galera                  create succeeded   dedicated-mysql-broker
  ```

### Database client operations

* Create accounts on it: this is done via a service binding.  You do that like so:
  ```
  $ cf bs spring-music ha-mysql
  ```
  You can then view the credentials for this service binding.  The `VCAP_SERVICES` environment
  variable holds the credentials the app will use to access the service instance:
  ```
  $ cf env spring-music
  Getting env variables for app spring-music in org pde / space dev as mgoddard...
  OK

  System-Provided:
  {
   "VCAP_SERVICES": {
    "p.mysql": [
     {
      "binding_name": null,
      "credentials": {
       "hostname": "q-n3s3y1.q-g222.bosh",
  ... [redacted for brevity]

  ```
* Create tables/accounts on it
Here is a [Reference](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-services.html#ssh-tunnel)
on using an SSH tunnel to access a DB instance.
  - Create a service key for the DB instance:
    ```
    $ cf create-service-key db-small-dev db-small-dev-key
    Creating service key db-small-dev-key for service instance db-small-dev as mgoddard...
    OK

    ```
  - Then, retrieve the service key:
    ```
    $ cf service-key db-small-dev db-small-dev-key
    Getting key db-small-dev-key for service instance db-small-dev as mgoddard...

    {
     "hostname": "q-n3s3y1.q-g204.bosh",
     ... [redacted]
    ```
  - Next, set up an SSH tunnel to the app instance which is bound to this DB instance:
    ```
    $ cf ssh -L 13306:q-n3s3y1.q-g204.bosh:3306 spring-music
    vcap@550dfdb5-71aa-4325-4b9d-830a:~$
    ```
  - Finally, connect to the DB instance using the credentials provided in the service key:
    ```
    $ mysql -u 98d0c215c22942138a8ae22ebbfadceb -h 0 -p -P 13306 service_instance_db
    Enter password:
    Reading table information for completion of table and column names
    You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

    mysql>
    ```
  - At this point, you are able to create tables, etc.:
    ```
    mysql> create table user (id int not null auto_increment, first varchar(255), last varchar(255), primary key (id));
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.11 sec)

    mysql> desc user;
    +-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | Field | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
    +-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | id    | int(11)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
    | first | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
    | last  | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
    +-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    3 rows in set (0.10 sec)

    mysql>

    ```

### High Availability

* Online operations where applicable.  If one node is unavailable, the other node takes over (e.g. maintenance, failure, etc.).
* Create/drop/add the read only DB (HA or DR within the same setup) – Availability Zone
* Transparent to apps on primary instance
* Ease of doing so, and the considerations
* Demonstrate the read/write and read-only directed according to port usage
* Either do it via application or via the psql client
* Inject activity and check if the WAL is near instantaneous even when in Async mode
* To verify what happens if a misconfigured write is directed on the read only instance

### Patching/upgrade using BOSH framework

* Demonstrate the role change (read/write instance becomes read, read instance becomes read/write)
* Inject activities
* Role change
* Impact ?
* Demonstrate the Patch/Upgrade of the PostgreSQL (read only instance)
* How fast is the role switch?
* How transparent is the role switch?
* Follow-up patching of the new read instance (after the role switch)
* Demonstrate the Patch/Upgrade of the PostgreSQL (read/write instance)
* How fast is the patching/upgrade?
* How transparent is patching/upgrade?
* Follow-up patching  on the read instance
* Role switch after patching

### Backup & Restore

* Demonstrate the backup & recovery
* Do a full backup
* Inject activities into the DB
* Data is logically corrupted eg accidentally deleted
* Perform point-in-time recovery to prior the deletion

### Demonstrate the monitoring and performance tuning

* This is an opinionated offering, the tile, but we can use indexes, compression, and choice of instance type
for tuning to workload requirements.
* Create a huge table (don’t create index)
* Inject 1 million rows
* Perform a select with where clause – full table scan
* Facility to show the DB activities, breakdown CPU / Memory / IO info, execution plan, tuning required etc.
* Create the index as suggested
* Run query again
* Facility to show the DB activities, breakdown CPU / Memory / IO info, execution plan, tuning required etc. of the tuned query
* Index rebuild if applicable
* Table rebuild if applicable
