# Workshop to explore various topics related to running the Pivotal MySQL database as a service

## Part 2

### Setup – HA cluster (Galera)
* Create an instance of an HA MySQL DB
  We can do this using the command line:
  ```
  $ cf create-service p.mysql db-ha-galera ha-mysql
  Creating service instance ha-mysql in org pde / space dev as mgoddard...
  OK

  Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service ha-mysql' to check operation status.
  $ cf services
  Getting services in org pde / space dev as mgoddard...

  name           service   plan           bound apps     last operation       broker                   upgrade available
  db-small-dev   p.mysql   single-node    spring-music   create succeeded     dedicated-mysql-broker
  ha-mysql       p.mysql   db-ha-galera                  create in progress   dedicated-mysql-broker
  ```
  or via the Apps Manager GUI.

### Database client operations

* Create tables/accounts on it

### High Availability

Online operations where applicable.  If one node is unavailable, the other node takes over (e.g. maintenance, failure, etc.).
Create/drop/add the read only DB (HA or DR within the same setup) – Availability Zone
Transparent to apps on primary instance
Ease of doing so, and the considerations
Demonstrate the read/write and read-only directed according to port usage
Either do it via application or via the psql client
Inject activity and check if the WAL is near instantaneous even when in Async mode
To verify what happens if a misconfigured write is directed on the read only instance

### Patching/upgrade using BOSH framework

Demonstrate the role change (read/write instance becomes read, read instance becomes read/write)
Inject activities
Role change
Impact ?
Demonstrate the Patch/Upgrade of the PostgreSQL (read only instance)
How fast is the role switch?
How transparent is the role switch?
Follow-up patching of the new read instance (after the role switch)
Demonstrate the Patch/Upgrade of the PostgreSQL (read/write instance)
How fast is the patching/upgrade?
How transparent is patching/upgrade?
Follow-up patching  on the read instance
Role switch after patching


### Backup & Restore

Demonstrate the backup & recovery
Do a full backup
Inject activities into the DB
Data is logically corrupted eg accidentally deleted
Perform point-in-time recovery to prior the deletion

### Demonstrate the monitoring and performance tuning

* This is an opinionated offering, the tile, but we can use indexes, compression, and choice of instance type
for tuning to workload requirements.

Create a huge table (don’t create index)
Inject 1 million rows
Perform a select with where clause – full table scan
Facility to show the DB activities, breakdown CPU / Memory / IO info, execution plan, tuning required etc.

Create the index as suggested
Run query again
Facility to show the DB activities, breakdown CPU / Memory / IO info, execution plan, tuning required etc. of the tuned query
Index rebuild if applicable
Table rebuild if applicable
